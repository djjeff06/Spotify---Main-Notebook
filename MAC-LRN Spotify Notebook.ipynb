    "In recent years, music revenue in the United States has seen substantial growth. In 2017, revenues from recorded music in the United States increased 16.5% at estimated retail value to $8.7 billion, continuing the growth from the previous year. Paid subscriptions from streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music were the biggest growth driver for the music industry in 2017. The revenues from streaming platforms made up 65% of total industry revenues. [1] Online streaming can now be seen as \n",

    "This research uses data from two Kaggle datasets, namely Spotify’s Worldwide Daily Song Ranking [1] and Top Spotify Tracks of 2017 [2]. The former is a collection of Spotify’s most streamed songs in different regions across the world for each day of 2017. Each row contains a ranking position on a specific day and region. There are roughly 200 entries per day for each region, however be aware that some of Spotify's data was missing in very few occasions. Due to this, the researchers have only focused on the streams (stream count) column for each entry. The latter is a collection of the audio features of the songs found in the Top Spotify Tracks of 2017 playlist in Spotify. Aside from the song title, artist and song url, each song is given values for 13 audio features listed and defined by Spotify API below.\n",
